"""
Standard Data Types
The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example,
a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her
address is stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has
various standard data types that are used to define the
operations possible on them and the storage method for
each of them.

Python has five standard data types âˆ’

Numbers
String
List
Tuple
Dictionary
